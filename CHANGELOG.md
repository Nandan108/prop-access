## [0.2.0] â€“ 2025-06-22
### Added
- `AccessorRegistry::getValueMap()` to directly extract resolved values from a value source
- `AccessorRegistry::resolveValues()` to apply a getter map and resolve values
- `AccessorRegistry::canGetGetterMap()` and `canGetSetterMap()` to detect resolver support
- `$throwOnNotFound` option to `getGetterMap()` and `getSetterMap()` for graceful fallback

### Changed
- Default object resolvers now explicitly exclude `SplObjectStorage` and `WeakMap` to prevent ambiguous key/value behavior in querying contexts
